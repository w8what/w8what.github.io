			<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
			<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>
			<p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's work, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>
			<p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

		<h1>The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>
		<p>Euler's Equation</p>
		<p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var> <sup>(ix)</sup></p>
		<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the identity</p>
		<p><var>e</var><sup>(&pi; <var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>
		<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named Euler's Identity as the most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.</p>
